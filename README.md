# Summer2025Research

Here lies all of my stuff that I worked on over the Summer of 2025, under the Europa ICONS program. My overall project is focused on modelling
charged particle and dust grain trajectories in the electromagnetic environment around Europa. I also experiment with modelling the distribution
of particles in Europa's exosphere and the effect of a potential plume on it, testing Europa Clipper data acquired from a flyby, and simulating 
the electromagnetic environment of Ganymede.

Initial_Exercise is my warm up work to demonstrate to my mentor my basic understanding of space physics and numerical modelling.

first_modelling_attempt is my iterations of my programs for modelling the different experiments described above, from the beginning of my internship to its end.

Final Outcomes (?) are the final versions of my programs and their output graphics.
