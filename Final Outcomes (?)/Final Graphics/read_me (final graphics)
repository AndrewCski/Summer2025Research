Here I store the graphics of simulations that I have ran.

- Europa B Field Plots are varying gifs of the behavior of Europa's magnetic environment over a synodic period

- Europa Backwards Modelling is the plots describing particle behavior when simulated backwards from the Europa Surface

- Europa Flyby Simulating is plots depicting particle distrbutions in Europa's exosphere, as well as theoretical Europa Clipper
readings from passing by the moon

- Europa Plume Particle Modelling is plots describing the behavior of individually simulated ions and dust grains ejected from
Europa's surface from a plume 

- Ganymede B Field Plots are varying gifs of the behavior of Ganymede's magnetic environment over a synodic period

- Ganymede Backwards Modelling is the plots describing particle behavior when simulated backwards from the Ganymede Surface

- Io Dust Tracing is plots describing the behavior of ionized dust particles from Io passing by Europa and Ganymede
