Here I include two things, as one is a component of the other:

1. Some exosphere and plume particle distribution plots are provided. These are generated by using the neutral density distribution equations
created by Jia et al. The model can simulate a plume at any point on Europa's surface.

2. Assuming that the Europa Clipper will effectively be taking a path that is a straight line behind Europa on its flybys, I model readings that the
REASON, Magnetometer, and SUDA instruments would pick up when performing a flyby of Europa. The magnetometer is represented by the measured components 
and total magnitude of the magnetic field, SUDA is represented by the picked up neutral particle densities encountered by the spacecraft, and
REASON is represented by the electron column densities measured during the flyby.

The magnetic field measurements are from the Jovian background field and induced field of Europa. The neutral particle densities are modelled from #1 above,
and the electron column densities are taken using the O+ and O++ ionization rates proposed by Jia et al. Using a particle lifetime that scales by altitude,
I take the neutral densities measured on a line between the spacecraft's position and the center of Europa, multiply them by the ionization rates and add these
together, then multiply the result by the lifetimes for each altitude. From this found electron density at each altitude, I integrate to get an electron column
density measured by the spacecraft.

The trajectories taken by the spacecraft are displayed in the "SpaceCraft Trajectories" images. Gifs of the readings over each flyby are provided here, 
where each frame is the measurements taken over the flyby with a different plume position. In the gifs, theta is the latitude of the plume opening on the surface,
phi is the plume opening longitude (0 degrees is facing Jupiter, 90 facing Europa orbital direction, etc.).
