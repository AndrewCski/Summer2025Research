Here I include gifs depicting the behavior of the magnetic field around Ganymede across one synodic period of the moon. These
each capture a different component of the field in a different set of axes. This is the same field utilized in other Ganymede simulations here,
and the three components of the field here are the Jovian background field, Ganymede's weak induced dipole field, and the moon's intrinsic dipole field.
