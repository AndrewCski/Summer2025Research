Here I include gifs depicting the behavior of the magnetic field around Ganymede across one synodic period of the moon. These each capture a 
different component of the field in a different set of axes. I also include snapshots of each of the components of the B field at Ganymede's
surface at different points in its synodic period, meant to be paired with accessibility plots (they are in similar format). This is the same 
field utilized in other Ganymede simulations here, and the three components of the field here are the Jovian background field, Ganymede's weak 
induced dipole field, and the moon's intrinsic dipole field.
