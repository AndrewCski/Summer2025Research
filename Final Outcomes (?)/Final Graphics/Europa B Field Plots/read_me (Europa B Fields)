Here I include gifs depicting the behavior of the magnetic field around Europa across one synodic period of the moon. These
each capture a different component of the field in a different set of axes. I also include snapshots of each of the components of the B field at Europa's
surface at different points in its synodic period, meant to be paired with accessibility plots (they are in similar format).This is the same field 
utilized in other Europa simulations here, and the two components of the field here are the Jovian background field and Europa's induced dipole field.
