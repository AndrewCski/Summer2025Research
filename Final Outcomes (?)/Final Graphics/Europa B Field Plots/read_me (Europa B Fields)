Here I include gifs depicting the behavior of the magnetic field around Europa across one synodic period of the moon. These
each capture a different component of the field in a different set of axes. This is the same field utilized in other Europa simulations here,
and the two components of the field here are the Jovian background field and Europa's induced dipole field.
