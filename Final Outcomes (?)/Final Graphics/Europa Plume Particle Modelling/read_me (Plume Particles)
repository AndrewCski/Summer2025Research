Here I numerically trace the trajectories of particles ejected from plumes on the surface of Europa. The following settings are used in each
case, and those after are for modelling dust grains or ionized particles.

- opening angle of plume is 15 degrees
- angles relative taken to surface are 0:1:15 degrees
- theta and phi refer to latitude and longitude of plume opening, respectively (Phi = 0 is towards Jupiter, 90 is Europa orbital direction, etc.)
- an E = -v x B electric field is utilized here. This is meant to replicate the electric field generated from passing ambient magnetospheric plasma.
v = 90 km/s in the x direction.

Dust:

- initial velocity directions utilized are 0:15:359 degrees (0 is north, 90 is east, etc.)
- dust grain radii of 10^-7 - 10^-3 m are used
- corresponding initial speeds are pulled from Degruyter et al.'s paper
- q/m ratios of 0, 1, and 10 C/kg are used
- dust grain density is set to 920 kg/m^3

Ions:

- initial velocity directions utilized are 0:1:359 degrees 
- initial speeds from 100 to 10000 m/s are used
- H+ is utilized here

For attached plots, "energy diffs" refers to the changes in particle energies from ejection to reimpact, "Height Dists" refers to the amount of particles that
achieved certain maximum altitudes above the surface, "Max Heights" refers to the maximum heights achieved by particles of certain configurations (radii or initial
energy for dust and ions, respectively), and "Impact Rates" refers to the normalized rates at which modelled particles impact sections of a grid overlaid onto 
Europa's surface (NOTE: the "tendrils" from the plume bases here are from me only being able to simulate so many particles ejected in so many directions, this
is should NOT be a physical phenomenon!). Some trajectory plots are included too to display particle behaviors. t0 and t25 refer to if the simulation happens at
the start of a synodic period (0, x component of B at + maximum) or a quarter of the way through (25 y component of B at - maximum)

Plume locations are more limited in ion simulations as I find that particles are being draged away from Europa in a nearly identical manner for a starting points
that are not on the flow-facing side of the moon. For both dust and ions, particles are generally dragged to the East/South-East when looking at the surface,
the result of B field and E field interference.
