Here I numerically trace the trajectories of particles ejected from plumes on the surface of Europa. The following settings are used in each
case, and those after are for modelling dust grains or ionized particles.

- opening angle of plume is 15 degrees
- angles relative taken to surface are 0:1:15 degrees
- directions utilized are 0:1:359 degrees (0 is north, 90 is east, etc.)

Dust:

- dust grain radii of 10^-7 - 10^-3 m are used
- corresponding initial speeds are pulled from Degruyter et al.'s paper
- q/m ratios of 0, 1, and 10 C/kg are used
- dust grain density is set to 920 kg/m^3
- an E = -v x B electric field is utilized here. This is meant to replicate the electric field generated from passing ambient magnetospheric plasma.
v = 90 km/s in the x direction.

Ions:

- initial speeds from 1000 to 50000 m/s are used
- H+ is utilized here
