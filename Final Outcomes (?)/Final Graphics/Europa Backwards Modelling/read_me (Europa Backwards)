Here I include my Accessibility Plots from modelling ions around Europa. By accessibility plots, I mean the rates at which particles started in a
uniform grid and at varying energies and impact directions around Europa's surface are able to escape the planet when traced back in time.

Paramters:

Synodic Period of 11.23 Hours
Thetas (Latitude): -90:5:90
Phis (Longitude): 0:5:359
Incident Angles (angle relative to normal of surface at impact point): 0:10:80
Impact Direction Angles (North/East/South/West at Surface Direction of Impact): 0:60:359
Jovian Background Field is [75 * cos(omega * t), -200 * sin(omega * t); -385] nT (x, y, and z in EPhiO Coordinates)
An induced dipole field of -(4*pi/mu0) * B_prim .* (R_E^3)/2 J/T is used (B_prim is Jovian field without z component, R_E is Europa radius)
Gravity is enabled

Each folder specifies the element used, impact energy used, and the point in the synodic period that the simulation is started in.
