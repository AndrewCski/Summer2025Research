Here I include results from attempting to trace Io Dust particles circulating around the Jovian system and passing by Europa or Ganymede. 

Io dust is simulated by starting it in the -x EPhiO/GPhiO direction and launching it forward in the +x direction towards Europa/Ganymede until it
hits the moon or passes by far enough to not turn back in. Plots included are trajectories taken by the dust, as well as normalized accessibility plots
indicating how often particles started in certain positions hit the moon and how often certain parts of the moon are hit. Most of the accessibility
plots only have 0/100 everywhere, but this would change if particles of multiple different parameters were run at once, such as varying initial velocity angles,
q/m ratios, or masses. The following are the parameters used:

Generally:

- particles are started at beginning of moon's synodic period or 1/4 through ("t0" and "t25" in file names)
- q/m ratios used are 1000, 2000, and 5000 C/kg
- particles are started at -3 moon radii in the x direction, and a 2.5 x 2.5 moon radii grid on the yz axis
- particle radii of 10e-9 m and density 2500 kg/m^3 are used
- 900 particles are simulated in total, uniformly distributed about the starting grid

Europa:

- initial velocity is 100000 m/s in x direction

Ganymede:

- initial velocity is 200000 m/s in x direction
