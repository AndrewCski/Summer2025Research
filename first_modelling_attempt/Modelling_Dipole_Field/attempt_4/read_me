Here I change the code to track multiple particles rather than one. I add an extra dimension to my arrays that store the data, and change the structure of the 
code to accomodate for this change in structure and handle each particle individually. 

The particles are still being traced backwards from their final impact on Europa. I am currently modelling their impact velocities as being 10000000 m/s
radially indwards toward Europa at their impact sites.

I included two plots, one for a smaller number of particles being modelled, and another ('120_particles') for an increased number of them. In my code, taking
inspiration from Nordheim, I create a set of points around the surface of Europa at various gaps in theta and phi angles where the particles hit Europa. I used
dTheta = 30 and dPhi = 60 degrees for the first plot, and dTheta = 20 and dPhi = 30 for the 120 particles plot.

I also took inspiration from Nordheim by including an additional break condition in the loop, as not only does it break upon particles impacting Europa, but 
it also breaks once they are more than 10 Europa radii away from the moon (their behavior from that far out doesnt tend to be interesting/worth modelling, and 
they just clutter the graphics). This does not really come into play until I have really high energy particles, who will be modelled not as coming from Europa
like most of what you can see in the attached graphic, but instead spiraling towards Europa, mostly like the 2 particles you can see coming from outside on the
attached graphic (but oscillating in a circle much more as they come in!)

I find it interesting that most of the particles, even of energies like here of 0.5 MeV (that's pretty energetic, right?) are getting modelling results of
just coming from Europa and doing a little loop around before landing back on Europa again. Could this be some modelling issue?

I also noticed I put ^-19 instead of ^-9 for the primary B-field magnitude before... Fixed this here!
