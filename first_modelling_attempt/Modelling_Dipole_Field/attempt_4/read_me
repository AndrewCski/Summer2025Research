Here I change the code to track multiple particles rather than one. I add an extra dimension to my arrays that store the data, and change the structure of the 
code to accomodate for this change in structure and handle each particle individually. 

I also took inspiration from Nordheim by including an additional break condition in the loop, as not only does it break upon particles impacting Europa, but 
it also breaks once they are more than 10 Europa radii away from the moon (their behavior from that far out doesnt tend to be interesting/worth modelling, and 
they just clutter the graphics)
