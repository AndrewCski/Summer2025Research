here, there are 2 things of note:

1. I change the numerical model to trace the movement of a particle back in time from a final position and velocity

2. I found an error in how I represented the primary field of Jupiter, which took the form of applying the z-component only in the loop rather than in the definition
of the priamry field (this messes up the secondary field since it is calculated without the z part of the primary field!). This has been fixed here.
