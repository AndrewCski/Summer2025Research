for this iteration of my program for modelling particle motion, I allow particles to strike Europa at angles rather than only directly into the surface. This is done
by creating a set of axes around the impact site on Europa, and using a variety of impact angles and directions of impact. Figuring out how to represent the coordinates
of this took a while, in addition to writing the code since I made a stupid error in defining one of my loops...

Im starting to think now about how I want to represent my results, as just displaying the trajectories of all of the modelled particles is starting to not work out,
since the graphic is starting to get cluttered!
