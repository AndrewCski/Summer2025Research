Here I change the Boris pusher that I have been using to account for relativity, displayed by the equation of motion highlighted in Nordheim's paper. 

I inserted a paper that I initially found helpful into the google drive. The 'initially' comes from the fact that adopting the scheme used in the paper resulted in energy no 
longer being conserved (I maybe implemented it wrong, not trying to say the author is wrong!). I changed the Boris pusher to work with relativistic momentum rather than velocity,
and that seemed to fix the issue.

I modelled the trajectories of a few particles to just check if they follow the same path as my previous code, and I also include their energies in a plot. If you look closely, you should 
see multiple lines on the plot (one per particle), and some of them are cut off early since they impact into Europa sooner than others. Also, my tracing the particles back in time is 
why the plot is going back in time. 

It overall seems like the code is working without issue! I think that I will move onto thinking about the upcoming presentation a bit and finding what velocity I could use for the 
Electric field generated by orbiting plasmas.
