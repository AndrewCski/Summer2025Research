For this iteration of the particle tracer, I implemented the ability to model various elements of particles rather than only
hydrogen ions. In this instance, I tested the model's ability to model H+, O++, and S+++, depicted in the figures in this folder.
Each element modelled needs to have its mass, charge, and name implemented into the main folder, and I also changed the files
for starting the particles and plotting the particle trajectories to account for the new addition, hence their redesign here.

I'm trying to think through whether the results I am currently getting makes sense right now. both O++ and S+++ have lower
q/m ratios than H+, meaning that the electromagnetic forces on them should be weaker. Although, their increased masses should
mean that they have lower velocities in order to have the same energies as the other elements, which would make the magnetic
forces on them even weaker (this is what keeps them on Europa!). Therefore, the electric forces on them should be more easily
overpowering the magnetic forces and dragging them away from Europa?
