here I am focused on recreating the magnetic field described in Zimmer's paper. I experiment with different starting positions and velocities to get 
an idea of how the field behaves.

I will enumerate my iterations of the code by the file names, unless specified we can assume that the most recent attempt # is the best/one that
I want you to read (yes, you my reader!)
