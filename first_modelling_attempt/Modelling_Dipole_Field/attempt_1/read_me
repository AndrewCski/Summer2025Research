Here I did the Zimmer Dipole with a radial component and azimuthal component corresponding to their defined cartesian axes and stated strengths of the
field in these axes (amplitude of 200nT for radial component, 75nT for azimuthal component, did they consider the tagential component irrelevant?)

I am just plopping a proton 2 Europa radii away from europa on the x axis, and am messing with a velocity of 950 km/s in the x-direction. This will be changed
when I go over Nordheim's paper again and try to implement it/learn from it...
