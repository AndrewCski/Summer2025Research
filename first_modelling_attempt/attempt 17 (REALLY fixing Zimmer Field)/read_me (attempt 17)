In this iteration I fix a mistake that has been plaguing me for a while, calculating the magnetic moment with the 
z-component of the B field. I now introduce the Bz component to the primary field after calculating the secondary
field. I also keep my new results here.

I also note that I rewrote my main final since it is starting to become a pain to deal with memory/processing time issues.
It has been further optimized to waste less space and run faster (to be honest it will still be slow, but it really should
be more efficient on memory and be able to handle more!)
