In this iteration I fix a mistake that has been plaguing me for a while, calculating the magnetic moment with the 
z-component of the B field. I now introduce the Bz component to the primary field after calculating the secondary
field. I also keep my new results here.

I also note that I rewrote my main final since it is starting to become a pain to deal with memory/processing time issues.
It has been further optimized to waste less space and run faster (to be honest it will still be slow, but it really should
be more efficient on memory and be able to handle more!)

For my results (in "initial new results"), the stuff at the surface level is what I initially created to test how the new Zimmer 
field interacts with and without an E field generated. From here, we decided to not use the E field. The H+/O++/S+++ folders 
contain images of the access maps for simulations of these elements, where I simulated them in high resolution (compared to before at 
least, my optimizations have helped me get away with more!) with the following parameters:

Thetas: -90:5:90
Phis: 0:5:359
Incident Angles: 0:10:80
Impact Direction Angles: 0:60:359
E field off
Induced field is on (done correctly now)
Gravity not used
Modelled from beginning of synodic period

In truth, I consider the results between the three elements to be a little more similar than I expected. This makes me wonder if I defined
O++ and S+++ correctly, and if there is anything I am missing.

NOTE: turns out I incorrectly wrote out the dipole equation in my code a bit, which significantly changes the results here! Real results will be posted later.
