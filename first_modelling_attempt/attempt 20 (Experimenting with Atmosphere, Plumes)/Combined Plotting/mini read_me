Here I do a combined plot of the B-fields and densities encountered by the Europa Clipper passing through a trajectory.
The chosen trajectory here is from y = -5 R_E to 5 R_E, and x = -1.05 * R_E. A plume has been set at theta = phi = 0.
Plotting the densities is a little annoying, as the two plotted here vary significantly in magnitude from each other 
and both spike heavily at the plume.

I am not sure how to implement ionization rates here. Jia gives constant ionization rates of 10^-6 per sec for O2+ production
and 10^-7 per sec for O+ production, and states that they calculate the corresponding ion production rates by multiplying the neutral 
density by the given ionization rates. What would I turn this into? Would it make sense to multiply the measured neutral densities in
the attached plot by these numbers and state the results to be measured ionization rates for these elements?
