Here I experiment with setting up Europa's atmosphere/exosphere (neutrals) and placing plumes on the surface.

In "Europa Neutrals", I first set up the atmosphere/exosphere distribution around Europa.

In "Plume Experimentation", I add onto this by including the ability to randomly place plumes around the surface.

So far, I am tempted to believe my results look rather good. However, I notice in my plume plot that the peak density is nowhere near
that of the Jia et al. paper (the max I am seeing is ~5e13 / cm^-3, the one they got is 3e20 / m^-2). The differing units (m^-2?) makes
me wonder if I am doing this wrong. I tried fixing it to display cm^-2 per box, and this got me closer to their results (max 10^17/m^2), 
but still not there.
