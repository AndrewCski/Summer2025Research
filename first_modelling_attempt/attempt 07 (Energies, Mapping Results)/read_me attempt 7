Here I change my code to include energies as another parameter that can be set differently for different particles. The energies for individual
particles are represented by the bars on the right of each plot. 

I observe that higher energies are more likely to not return to Europa's surface when modelled backwards, which I suppose makes sense. There does not seem to
be too much of a pattern in the landing sites for particles of varying energies, but this could be due the amount of simulated particles being relatively low still.
