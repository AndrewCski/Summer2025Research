Plotting the trajectories of particles when I start simulating thousands of them is very cumbersome, ESPECIALLY in the tens of thousands, 
where matlab begins to run the risk of crashing when attempting to plot the trajectories. To get around this, I chose to make plots of the fluxes
of particles around Europa rather than plotting the trajectories themselves. This takes more computation time to do, but visualizing is far quicker,
making this overall more fast and stable. 

I include the flux plots and also trajectory plots with lower amounts of particles to demonstrate that it is working. I include two versions of the
function file, Europa_Particle_Flux.m and True_Europa_Particle_Flux.m. The latter has a change in its algorithm and also calculation of flux, but I
did not want to get rid of the original form in case I wanted to use that instead. The function works by counting how many times particles enter
gridspaces in the region around Europa, with the divergence between the two files being that the original will only count a particle entering a
box once, while the new version counts it everytime a particle enters a box, even if it has done so before. In addition, the new version of the
file takes the rate at which particles enter gridspaces per second, while the original does the rate per second and per square meter. I chose to
get rid of the unit area calculation and division in the flux calculation, but it would be easy to reimplement if necessary. The flux plots here
are done with the new version of the function.
