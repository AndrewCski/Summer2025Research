Here I implement a function to display the number of particles of each energy that 'escape' from Europa ('' is for the fact that I
am current modelling backwards in time). Messing around with a few different simulation parameters, I keep seeing what is shown here, which 
is that the lowest energy particles on the backside of Europa are carried away the most, due to the addition of the E-field. Then, regardless 
of whether there is an E-field or not, the high energy particles at the poles of Europa tend to fly away as well. 

This can be seen in the trajectories and rates plots that I attached to this folder. The rates folder is just a histogram that depicts the
number of escaped particles per energy, with the total number of particles modelled per energy displayed in the title.
