Here I include my code for modelling particles sourced from a plume on Europa. The code includes the ability to set a plume at any
longitude/latitude on the surface of Europa. You also have the ability to set the following characteristics of the plume/particles
that are sourced from it:

- opening angle of the plume
- angles taken relative to the surface of released particles
- directions taken by the particles (North, East, etc.)
- initial speeds of particles
- q/m ratios of particles
- radii of particles (I am assuming that dust grains are being used here)
- densities of dust grains

The code will then release the particles from the set plume and model them until they hit the simulation box border (2 Europa radii)
or hit the surface again. Gravity is enabled here, which ends up playing a surprisingly signicant role. The Jovian field is set to the
be at the beginning of a synodic period, meaning maximum strength in positive x and y directions. In the attached plots, I use the
following parameters:

- plume set at theta = phi = 0, or directly facing towards -x direction, the flow facing side of Europa
- opening angle of plume is 15 degrees
- angles relative taken to surface are 0:3:15 degrees
- directions utilized are 0:60:359 degrees (0 is north, 90 is east, etc.)
- initial speeds of 100 m/s and 1000 m/s are used
- q/m ratios of 100 and 1000 C/kg are used
- dust grain radii of 10, 20, and 30 nm are used
- dust grain density is set to 2500 kg/m^3
