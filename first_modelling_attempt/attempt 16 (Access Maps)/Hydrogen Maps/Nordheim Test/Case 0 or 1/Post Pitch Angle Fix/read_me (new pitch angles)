Thought I would include my thoughts here.

I have created a new function for generating starting states of particles based on provided latitudes, longitudes, pitch angles, and
phase angles (I realized I never accounted for this!). I note that these results do not seem as accurate to Nordheim's case 0 results as before the
pitch angle fix (included in "Pre Pitch Angle Fix"). I included a graphic of the trajectories my function generates when I instruct it to create particles 
at latitudes 90/0/-90 (deg), longitudes 90/270 (deg), pitch angles 0/30/60/90/120/150/180, and phase angles 0/180. When Nordheim states that he starts the 
particles at all possible phase and pitch angles, is this what he means (ignoring that I do a very limited range here)?

I note how particles in the positive x direction are going to struggle without very wide gyroradii to escape Europa with this field configuration. 
The way that I programmed my function to compute the two perpendicular bases to the magnetic fields at points around the surface is just going to pick
one direction for all points when the field is uniform like this. Is this bad, and if reasonable, should it be changed?
