In this folder I leave my first attempts at modelling the magnetic environment around Europa (testing the secondary field from the Zimmer paper, 
trying to find out how to start and track particles according to Nordheim, etc.)

I will enumerate my program iterations by folder names. Unless otherwise specified, we can assume that the most recent attempt # is the best/one that
I want you to read (yes, you my reader!). read_me's in each folder will detail changes made since the last attempt.

CURRENT STATE OF THINGS: 

I have changed the particle in B/E-field tracker to work for Europa based on the magnetic field described in the Zimmer paper. I implemented the primary field and secondary field 
described in the paper, hopefully correctly, such that there is an oscillating x/y component to the primary field and a constant z component, and the secondary field reacts to this 
with the provided dipole equation. I have created heatmaps and 3D plots of the magnetic field at various times to check if it has been modelled correctly.

I have also changed the code to trace particle motion backwards and to trace multiple particles at once. Furthermore, I have introduced the ability for particles to strike Europa's 
surface at varying angles rather than exclusively radially inwards. I have been using this to see how particles that end up impacting Europa at various locations came from. The code now 
utilizes a relativistic equation of motion rather than a classical one.
