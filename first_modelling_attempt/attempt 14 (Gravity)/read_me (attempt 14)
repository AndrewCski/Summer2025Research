In this instance of my code, I implement gravititational force to my Boris pusher function, and also make a few unrelated
fixes within my code.

My implementation of gravity in the Boris pusher is very simple. Before I make my second E-field addition to a particle's
momentum, I add the change in momentum induced by gravitational force, taking the form -G * m * M * dt / r^2. Since this
is such a small shift for any object with a mass as small as an individual atom, I am going to just hope for now that it
is performing correctly (I did create some plots of the positions of particles to try to compare, but this went nowhere
so I did not include them here)...

I also include a new edition of my function for mapping particle impacts, as I found my previous version did not work in
instances where only a single energy of particle is able to escape Europa. The boris pusher function was also modified
to use a more intuitive scheme for enabling and disabling the E-field and gravity.
