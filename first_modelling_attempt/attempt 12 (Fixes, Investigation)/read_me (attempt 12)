This iteration and folder serves 2 purposes: 

1. Get a good view of behavior of particles from multiple angles, making it easier to interpret how particles are generally behaving

2. It should not be visually observable, but I made a fix to my function for creating particles from the given set of parameters. I was before
creating a bunch of duplicates at the poles, as longitudinally going around the moon at the poles makes no difference. In this instance, this 
reduced the number of simulated particles from 120 to 84. This will likely make less of a difference when I simulate particles at more starting
positions at once, but this will improve performance and statistical accuracy.
