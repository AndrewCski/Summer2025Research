Here I redid my funtion for mapping the impacts of particles on the surface of Europa, this time accounting for running the simulation
back in time. Using the starting positions instead of ending positions of particles and plotting only those that are modelled as having 
came from beyond Europa, we get a map of particles that strike Europa from another source. The parameters of this simulation are the same
as those of the attempt 12 folder, where I model H+/O++/S+++ together and at energies from 1 KeV-1MeV. 

This nets us higher energy particles impacting the poles of Europa, and multiple lower energy particles striking the moon from
the side facing the flow of plasma. Due to all sets of particles being started from the same grid spaces, there is some overlap in the
impact locations of particles, so that is why some points have multiple colors on them. I am currently wondering if there is a better way
to make sure all of the energies impacting a spot are made known.
