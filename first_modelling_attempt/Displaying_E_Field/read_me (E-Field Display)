Here I plot the Electric Field generated by ambient plasma around Europa in order to ensure it is being done correctly. I am currently using
v = 90000 m/s in the x-direction for the speed of the plasma, used in E = -v x B. The shape of these results, compared to that of Nordheim, I think match
at least relatively well if we can attribute the differences in our simulation vs those of Nordheim to his being of a magnetohydrodynamic simulation.

In regards to the velocity of the plasma, I note that using 90 km/s nets an electric field of relatively similar magnitude to that of Nordheim. I still
need to go through the paper to check what he actually uses, but this seems to be a good sign that I am simulating things correctly (I think).
