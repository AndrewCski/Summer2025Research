Here I try to replicate the Ganymede environment simulated in Stahl et al.'s and Liuzzo et al.'s papers.

In "field maps", I make plots of the magnetic field of Ganymede, attempting to mimic the first few plots of figure 2
in Stahl's paper, the field around Ganymede during the Juno PJ34 flyby. I so far have only really changed the background field, 
the size of the moon, and how the secondary field is computed (compute induced field basically same method as before, calculate 
permanent dipole in similar fashion). When I check the values of my fields, I get the following:

M_perm = -4.1 * 10^18 J/T x, 9 * 10^18 J/T y, -131 * 10^18 z
M_ind = 1.1474 * 10^18 J/T x, -1.8358 * 10^18 J/T y, 0 J/T z
M_ tot = -2.9526 * 10^18 J/T x, 7.1642 * 10^18 y, -131 * 10^18 z

These seem pretty similar to what Stahl had.
