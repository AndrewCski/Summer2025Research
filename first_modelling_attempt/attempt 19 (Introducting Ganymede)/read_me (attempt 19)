Here I try to replicate the Ganymede environment simulated in Stahl et al.'s and Liuzzo et al.'s papers.

In "field maps", I make plots of the magnetic field of Ganymede, attempting to mimic the first few plots of figure 2
in Stahl's paper, the field around Ganymede during the Juno PJ34 flyby. I so far have only really changed the background field, 
the size of the moon, and how the secondary field is computed (compute induced field basically same method as before, calculate 
permanent dipole in similar fashion). When I check the values of my fields, I get the following:

M_perm = -4.1 * 10^18 J/T x, 9 * 10^18 J/T y, -131 * 10^18 z
M_ind = 1.1474 * 10^18 J/T x, -1.8358 * 10^18 J/T y, 0 J/T z
M_ tot = -2.9526 * 10^18 J/T x, 7.1642 * 10^18 y, -131 * 10^18 z

These seem pretty similar to what Stahl had. The "matched" and "unmatched" in each plot's name means whether I matched the
colorbar to that of the plots I am making reference to or not.

The x, z, and total field plots seem pretty similar to their counterparts. However, the y field plot that I generated does not
seem to match that of Stahl's figure very much. Would this be due to their model being a fluid one rather than more analytical
like mine? I suppose that would also explain why the field lines of all of their plots seem to be flowing to the side a bit, while mine are
rather straight.

In this attempt folder, I include all of the function files that I had to mess with in order for them to be able to work for the Ganymede code.
There are a few more functions that I have not editted yet, but I am not going to bother with them for now as I do not expect them to be useful.
In the "test plots" folder, I also include plots of the fluxes of particles in regions around Ganymede (only simulating 1550 particles currently), as 
well as the trajectories of a few hundred of these particles and an accessibility plot for the 1550 particles.

NOTE: I only realized while working on this that my labelling on my flux plots has been incorrect, they should be per m^2 rather than m^3 for each square.
This will be fixed in future plots!

I am going to hold off from further testing until I get to confirm that my model of Ganymede is correct/elaborate enough to be satisfactory.
