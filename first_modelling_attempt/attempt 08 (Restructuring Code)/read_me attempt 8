Here I do not introduce any new exciting features to the code yet, but I instead chose to restructure my code to 
make it easier to parse/add onto. My one file that I have constantly been writing onto for each of these attempts has
started to get pretty long, so I think it is more convenient to have much of the mundane operations done in their own
function files and save the setting of parameters and tracking of results in the main file. Here, I call the main file
"Splitting_Boris_Pusher_into_functions_attempt8.m", but in the future I might just call this main_particle_tracking_file
or something. The functions of the other files put here are detailed in the comment blocks at their tops. I will probably
just slightly modify the main file and create a whole new function file for any future features that I add to our particle
tracking, which will be attached in the folders I put here in github.

Also, I noticed that I was slightly incorrect in how I was assigning initial velocities to particles. I was still using
KE = .5 * mv^2, but we are working with relativity now, so I have to instead use E = mc^2(sqrt(gamma^2 v^2 / c^2 + 1) - 1).
To streamline finding the velocities that correspond to energies following this equation, I created a few functions,
one for solving for the velocity, and another for taking eV energies as inputs rather than joules.
