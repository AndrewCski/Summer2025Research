Here I implement the Electric Field generated by Ambient magnetospheric plasma travelling in the x direction.
The field is calculated by performing E = -v x B for every step of every particle, using v = 90 km/s in the x direction
and using whatever B is calculated to be at the particle's position. I did not change anything in the main file for this
in particular, although I made a slight adjustment to how the array of times is created from the chosen timestep and period.
I include the Boris step file here as I changed it to include the option of using the electric field or not by inputting an
empty array or an array of 0's (former turns on E field, latter turns off).

This seems to produce the interesting result of lower energy particles on the backside of Europa (the side facing away from
Europa's orbital velocity) trailing off in generally that direction. This is indicated in the images I provided, which show 
a case of fewer particles modelled at once and the case of more particles being modelled at once to see how 
they behave at more positions/energies (..._Increased in file name). The images are also split into where I use the E-field
and not (Plasma_E_Field... and No_Plasma..., respectively). 

I think this makes sense, as the v x B component of the force acting on the lower energy particles is much weaker
than the higher energy ones, which allows the E component of the force to carry the particles away.
