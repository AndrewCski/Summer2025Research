I put my X-directional Electric field plots here.

I created plots for different amounts of particle cycles (eg 5 cycles or 10 cycles, indicated in their names)

The timesteps used for each plot are indicated at the ends of their names, like 0.0001s and 0.00001s.

From here, for each mix of timestep and number of cycles I plot the energy of the particle throughout its motion, 
its speed in the y direction throughout its motion, the percentage error between its y direction velocity and the 
analytical y-direction velocity, and its movement in the x and y dimensions.
